1. find existing formulations of multiagent gridworld problems


1. build simple goal finding gridworld problems

a. update env to hold the state of all relevant objects
    env in example holds different objects because its using OO-POMDP
    instead make world_state to define obstacles and targets

    agent does not hold state. it holds belief about its state.

        define belief representation for Agent class ***

b. make an actual example of agent going to target location
c. 

2. find way to update reward model to change goals -> search box reward -> search target reward
